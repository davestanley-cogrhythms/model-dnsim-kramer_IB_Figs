101a_RS_FS_LTS_only Got simple LTS response 1 cycle after AP pulse.
Fig1 - Initial simulation with weak RS->LTS input (gAMPA_rsLTS = 0.2/Nrs;)
Fig2 - Increased strenght of RS->LTS input (gAMPA_rsLTS = 0.3/Nrs;)
	Fig3 - Raster of above
Fig4 - Increse # cells
	Fig5 - Raster of above
Fig6 - Removed RS->LTS input to talk about expected behavior
