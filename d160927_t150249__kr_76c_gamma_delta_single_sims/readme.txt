76c_gamma_delta_single_sims Varied a bunch of things, greedily optimizing; see readme for details.. Generally I found that FS are too inhibited relative to RS. Also not sure what to do with IB PPStim.


Figs1-3; gamma, AP; no delta oscillator (AP pulse is at 1000 ms)
Figs4-8; gamma, AP; added delta oscillator
Figs9-10; no gamma; delta oscillator only
~also added in IB PPstim somewhere around here~~
Figs11-12; gamma, AP; delta+gamma oscillator, adjusted GABAB NG->RS (0.15)
Figs13-15; gamma, AP; delta+gamma oscillator, adjusted GABAB NG->RS (0.12)
