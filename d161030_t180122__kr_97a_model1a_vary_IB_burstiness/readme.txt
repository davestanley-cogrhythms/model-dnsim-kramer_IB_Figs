96a_model1b_vary_CaH_IM_IBPPStim Ran model1a while varying IB PPStim and also FS->IB connectivity. Ran separate simulations for different levels of excitability (gCaH and gM). 

**Unlike previous version, this one has AP pulse present**

Case 1: gCaH = 2 gM = 2
Case 2: gCaH = 3 gM = 2 
Case 3: gCaH = 4 gM = 3
