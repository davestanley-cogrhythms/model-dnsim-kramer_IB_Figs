88c_play_with_A_current Try lowered NG A-current to allow NG cells to more easily entrain to oscillatory 40Hz activity.

** Note I have blocked RS->NG synapses in this case, so we're back to the vanilla model! **

Delta oscillator only (Single sweeps)
	Figs 1-2 Default A current
	Figs 3-4 A current reduced to 10
Delta + gamma oscillator,
	Figs 5-6 A current 10
	Figs 7-8 A current 5
	Figs 9-10 A current back to 20
	Figs 11-13 A current zero

Conclusion: it seems that adjusting the A current doesn't have very much effect. The sparse firing of NG cells
	is probably more governed by the NMDA stimulation they receive and their recurrent inhibition.
	

	* Might need to increase # cells to see effects
