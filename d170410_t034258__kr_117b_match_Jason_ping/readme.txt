117b_match_Jason_ping Tried adjusting synaptic strengths and Vnoise to match Jason’s sPING
	Figs 1-3 My model (populations + Synapses). Matched synaptic conductances to Jason’s
	Figs 4-6 Went back to Jason’s model for populations. Used my synapses but matched to Jason’s conductances
	Figs 7-10 Continued altering model to reproduce Jasons’. Went to my model’s synapses + populations. Increased noise
	Figs 10-12 As before, but increased conductance.
