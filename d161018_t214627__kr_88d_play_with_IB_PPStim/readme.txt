88d_play_with_IB_PPStim
	Removed RS->NG synapse. Tried making IB cells more excitable under NMDA block conditions by
	including a PPStim current to IB cells.

	Conclusion: It seems that low IB stim values improve IB gamma, whereas
		high IB stim values actually suppress it! Probably need to alter
		the balance between IB->IB and IB->NG NMDA to make NMDA more effective
		at activating NG cells!
