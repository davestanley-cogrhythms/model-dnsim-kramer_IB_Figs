133a_LTS_FS_competition_play Added feedback from LTS cells to FS cells, allowing them to inhibit. Also increased RS injected current allowing to fire by rebound. Need to add M current to them as well.

1) LTS Stim = -4; RS->LTS stim = 0.4
2-5) LTS->FS set to 1.0; Increased RS stim from 0.5 to 0, so that they fire by “rebound” after the AP pulse
