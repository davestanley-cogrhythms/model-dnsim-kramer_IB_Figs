88e_play_IBNG_NMDA Tried increasing the gNMDA from IB to NG cells, in order to get a bigger effect of NMDA blockade on IB 40 Hz firing.

	Conclusion: Found that for very high levels of NMDA, (gNMDA_IB_NG ~ 9 or 11; bottom two rows)
	you do start to see a pretty big difference in IB 40 Hz power. This mainly occurs because IB
	activity is substantially quenched when NG cells are active.

	Also note, that I had to use much longer simulations here in order to allow for stabilization
	time. This can possibly be fixed by shortening time constant of GABA B.

	Note, from the single sweeps, that even short IB bursts for the AP pulse produce quite a bit of NG activity.
