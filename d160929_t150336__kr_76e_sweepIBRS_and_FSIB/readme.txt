76e_sweepIBRS_and_FSIB Used fixed IBPPStim of -2.5. Swept:
	IB->RS through [ 0.0500    0.0667    0.0833    0.1000] and
	FS->IB synapses through [ 0.4000    0.6000    0.8000    1.0000].

Surprisingly higher IB->RS synaptic strength actually helped things! But anything above FS->IB of 0.4 disrupted IB cell firing. Will probably stick to IB->RS of 0.8 or 0.1 and FS->IB of 0.4.
