Folders labeled RS_error had tried reducing NRS from 80 down to 20, but failed to account for the fact that synaptic connections were still being computed assuming NRS = 80

Pretty much all simulations 9a were using Nrs = 20. The exceptions to this are the last simulations, which are labeled as using the correct number of RS cells (NRS_80 suffix on foldername). Surprinsingly, this seemed to make a difference in getting a phase reset in the average figures!
