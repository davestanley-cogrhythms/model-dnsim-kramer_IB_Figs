76i_block_delta_to_gamma_FF_connections Used the same range as previous. Figs 1-6 no AP pulse; Figs 7-16 with AP pulse; Later exploring the timings.
	Fig 14: AP pulse happens at ~1237ms (25+11) and previous one at 1200ms. (this is showing raw PPStim train)
	Fig 16: However, FS synapse activity during AP pulse, difference between peaks is 1239-1208=31ms (contrast this to non-aperoidic puses with difference 1133-1108 = 25ms).
