67h_sweep_RS_PPstim_gammaAP Put gamma input back in. Sweep RS PPStim. Using Iapp to be so low as to not produce spontaneous gamma.
	Sweep range from RS PPStim -1 to -7.
	IApp held constant at 1.5 (no spontaneous firing!)
	From looking at this, PPStim of -4 or -5 seems good for producing
		both regular inhibition and also slow ramping up of gamma.
