101b_2D_sweep Swept LTS firing over RS->LTS and FS-LTS synapse strength.


Figs 1-2 'FS->LTS','g_SYN',[.2:.2:1]/Nfs;...
Figs 3-4 'FS->LTS','g_SYN',[.2:.1:.6]/Nfs;...

Below are all case 1 (single sims)
Figs 7-8 Set AP delay to 13 (previously was at 11)
Figs 9-11 Set AP delay back to 11. (Fig 11 plots synaptic currents)
Fig 12-14 Set AP delay to 16. Still produces burst on the 2nd one. What gives?!
