101d_test_noise_levels Tried varying the noise levels to see how this effects parameter regime for LTS burst.


2 sets of experiments 
	Exp1) with and without RS firing
	Exp2) Try increasing noise level

==Exp1==
Fig1-2 Default sweep through varying FS->LTS strength
Fig3-5 Disabled RS firing on the post-AP pulse (hinders LTS firing). (Switched RSPPStim from -10 to -7)

==Exp2==
Restored default RS PPStim value.
Now will start looking at effects of noise. Also, increased number of cells to 30 so can get a clearer sense.

Fig6-7 Default sim
Fig8-9 Decreased LTS Vnoise to zero (from default=3)
Fig10-12 Increased LTS Vnoise to 9 (Fig 12 shows mean LTS cell responses)
