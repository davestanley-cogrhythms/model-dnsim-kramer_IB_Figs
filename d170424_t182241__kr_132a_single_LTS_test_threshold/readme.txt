132a_single_LTS_test_threshold Went back to single LTS cell. Try to tune so get more depolarized firing potentials.
	Fig2 - Default Jung LTS (gNa=100; gK=80; gleak=0.1).
	Fig3 - Kramer LTS (gNa=200; gK=20; gleak=1);
	Fig4 - High leak LTS (gNa=100; gK=80; gleak=1)

Found that Fig3 and Fig4 produce more reasonable firing thresholds - around
-60 mV. Iâ€™ll stick with these!
