74a_delta_gamma_network - RS, FS, IB, NG cells. All synapses active (delta <-> gamma). Tuning delta-> gamma synapses. 
	Fig1 - IB->RS AMPA + NMDA both disconnected

	Varied gAMPA_ibrs ; 
	0.05 - Figs 4-5
	 0.1 - Figs 6-7

	Fig 8-10: Increased gNMDA_ibrs to 1.0 (from 0.5); decreased gAMPA_ibrs back to 0.05.
