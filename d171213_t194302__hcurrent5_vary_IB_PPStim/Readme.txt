In one of the previous simulation batches (hcurrent3), with gAR = 0.5, I did a 2D sweep. See last folder labeled "2D" in: d171212_t192103__kr_default_with_hcurrent3_gar0.5

Found it seemed I could get the desired offset effects, with IB cells bursting right after laser offset. Required lowering IB PPStim a bit, so that NG GABA B activity would be less. I tried this out here, with 2 different values of IB PPStim: 0.25 and 0.5.

Result: It didn't give us a reliable strong click train offset burst. It also kind of ruined the initial delta transient resposne. Hence, I'll scratch this for now.
