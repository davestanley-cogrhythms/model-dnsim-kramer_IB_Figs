117a_Jason_sPING Set up option to swap in Jasons sPING network.

Figs 1-3 My original PING network
Figs 4-6 Jasons sparse PING network with RS->FS at 0.1 (final); this value was incorrect. (FS->RS value was correct).
Figs 7-9 As above, now at correct values:
	RS -> FS: .1*80/Nrs = 0.2667
	FS -> RS: .1*20/Nfs = 0.0667
Figs 10-12 Now using traditional 80-20 ratio of RS to FS. Synaptic connectivity now at:
	RS -> FS: 0.1
	FS -> RS: 0.1
