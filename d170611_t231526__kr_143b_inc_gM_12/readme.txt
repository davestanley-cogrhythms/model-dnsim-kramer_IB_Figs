143b_inc_gM_12 Big change2: Further increased gM!

	Increased LTS gM to 12; Jlts = -3
		Now, LTS cells burst VERY early. This basically
		makes them all fire out, thus increasing their
		gM and self-inhibiting. Not sure yet how this works
		for stim at 30 Hz.

	Figs 4-7 are for gLTS->FS blocked and increasingly
		ramping up gLTS->RS. Trying to inhibit RS cells
		for a long time and seeing if this will produce
		a 2nd LTS burst. Seems M current is strong enough
		to keep them down for a while
