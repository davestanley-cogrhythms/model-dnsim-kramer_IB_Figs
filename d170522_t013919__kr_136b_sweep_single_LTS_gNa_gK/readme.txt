136b_sweep_single_LTS_gNa_gK Swept gLTS through a variety of Jlts, for different gNa, gK, and gM combinations. 

Figs 1-2) gNa/gK 100/80; gL = 0.1; gM = 4
Figs 3-4) Set gM to 0 
Figs 5-6) Set gM back to 4; gNa/gK 50/30. Gives somewhat more depolarized resting potential.

I will use this configuration if need be!
