78c_sweep_PPStim_NG_and_FSIB Swept through range of NG PPStim and FSIB synapse values. Figs1-4 with AP; 5-8 no AP.
	Note they use different ranges (FSIB is .3-.7 in Figs1-4; .4-.7 in Figs5-8; multiply by 24 to get correct range).
	Sweet spot seems to be NGStim = -3 and and synapse = 0.025 (0.025*24 = 0.6).
