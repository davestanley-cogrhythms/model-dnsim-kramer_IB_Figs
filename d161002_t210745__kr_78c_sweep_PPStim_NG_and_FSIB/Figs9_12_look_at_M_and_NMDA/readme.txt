Exact same sim as for Figs 9-12 in parent folder. It seems like GABA A + B inhibition reaches a minimum around 1000 seconds and yet there is no IB burst at this time (only isolated firing). See Figs 9 or 10 in parent folder. I'm exploring why this is.

I can see that M current is already ~0 at this time (Fig8, this folder), so the lack of IB burst is not due to M current. Rather, I think it's due to the NMDA current (Fig7, this folder), which builds up due to the sporadic IB firing and is strong enough to produce a pulse by the time of the AP pulse.
