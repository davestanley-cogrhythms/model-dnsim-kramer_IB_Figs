114b_tweak_PPstim_amp Found a good stimulus amplitude for FS cells (again, temporary for tuning). Still working on RS cells.


Disabled RS->FS. Instead we will try driving FS cells with PP Stem

~~~ Tune FS input (RS cells are not firing at all now) ~~~
Fig1 - Stimulating FS cells alone with various PPStim amplitudes


Fig2 - As above, but add back in gFS_FS

~~~ Tune RS input (keep FS cells firing at gamma to sync RS cells) ~~~
Fig3 - Take back out gFS_FS. Add in stimulation to RS.
Fig3b - Showing FS cells for reference
Fig3c - LTS cells
