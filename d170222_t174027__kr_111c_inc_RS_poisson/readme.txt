111c_inc_RS_poisson Greatly increased RS poisson noise. Reduced tonic injected current to compensate.


Pulse mode = 0
Fig 1 - RS inject = 1.5
Fig 2 - RS inject = 2.5

Fig 3 - Pulse mode = 1
Fig 4 - Temporarily disabled RS-> RS connections

Re-enabled RS->RS

Fig 5 - Lowered PP Stim for RS from -10 to -5

Fig 6 - Restored PP Stim for RS to -10

For next steps:
Key variables to adjust
	FS->RS inhibition (reduce as much as possible; limit-intrinsic gamma disappears)
	FS->FS inhibition (as small as possible until it still “skips a beat”)
	RS PP Stim (reduce and/or make broader so that RS cells fire driven by noise
	Try setting FS->FS to zero for now.
	

** maybe play around with increasing FS cell noise **
